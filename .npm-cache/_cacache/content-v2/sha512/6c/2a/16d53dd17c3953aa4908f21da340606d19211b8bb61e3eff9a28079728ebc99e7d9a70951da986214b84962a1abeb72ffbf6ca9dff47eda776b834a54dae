Use to\nlimit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.\nPlays nice with\n[express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down) and\n[ratelimit-header-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ratelimit-header-parser).\n\n## Usage\n\nThe [full documentation](https://express-rate-limit.mintlify.app/overview) is\navailable on-line.\n\n```ts\nimport { rateLimit } from 'express-rate-limit'\n\nconst limiter = rateLimit({\n\twindowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes\n\tlimit: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes).\n\tstandardHeaders: 'draft-8', // draft-6: `RateLimit-*` headers; draft-7 & draft-8: combined `RateLimit` header\n\tlegacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers.\n\tipv6Subnet: 56, // Set to 60 or 64 to be less aggressive, or 52 or 48 to be more aggressive\n\t// store: ... , // Redis, Memcached, etc. See below.\n})\n\n// Apply the rate limiting middleware to all requests.\napp.use(limiter)\n```\n\n### Data Stores\n\nThe rate limiter comes with a built-in memory store, and supports a variety of\n[external data stores](https://express-rate-limit.mintlify.app/reference/stores).\n\n### Configuration\n\nAll function options may be async.
